<h3>Abstract </h3>

In this technique,we take binaries of any type of digital data and convert it to DNA sequencing, reshape, encrypt, crossover, mutate and then reshape. The main stages of D-GET are repeated three times or more. Transmit the encrypted data in text/image format file. In other side, the receiver uses the D-GET to decrypt the received data and reshape it to original format. This Technique  multiple key sequences to increase the degree of diffusion and confusion, which makes resulting cipher data difficult to decipher and makes to realize a perfect secrecy system. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed technique has multilayer protection stages against different attacks and higher level of security based on the multi-stages and genetic operations. And a symentric key cryptography is implemented in this project.And also a random key will be generated.Decrypted data are acceptable because of there is absolutely difference between it and secret data.

<h3> Evaluation Results </h3>

The D-GET is implemented in the AMD Athlon(tm) II X2 220 Processor, 2.80GHz and 4 GB RAM on Windows 8.1 64-BIT operating system. We conduct experiments to test the efficacy of the proposed technique and run it with various types of secret data. 
Using all manner of cryptanalytic, mathematical and brute-force attacks,  cryptanalysts attack any encrypted data to discover its contents. A successful encryption technique against them should be robust. So, there are some features that need to be achieved. Here There is no relationship between, before encryption, sensitive data values and, after encryption, encrypted data values. Encryption should be blended around the various hidden data components so that nothing in its original position is presented.

<h3> Conclusions </h3>

D-GET is implemented in this project. The D-GET, based on multi-iteration and genetic activities, is a more stable encryption technique. Operations, encryption, rotation, crossover, mutation, and reshapes that improve the standard of encryption are also included. D-GET operations and modifications to the original data size and format. In addition, the negligible relationship in both the hidden data and its encrypted data decreases the possibilities of cryptanalysis and breaking the cypher. In addition, the technique has multilayer defence phases that achieve confidentiality and provide data with more security, productivity and robustness and protects against detection. We would standardise D-GET in future work and try to minimise transmission.
