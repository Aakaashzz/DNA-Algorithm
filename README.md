<h3>Abstract </h3>

In this method, binaries of any kind of digital data are converted to DNA sequencing, reshaped, encrypted, crossed over, mutated, and then reshaped. D-GET's primary stages are repeated three times or more. Send the text/image file containing the encrypted data. On the other hand, the receiver uses the D-GET to decrypt the data received and reformat it into its original format. This technique uses multiple key sequences to increase the degree of diffusion and confusion, which makes the resulting cypher data difficult to decipher and helps to realise a perfect secrecy system. 

Results from the experiments show that the suggested technique has multiple layers of defence against various attacks and a higher level of security based on multiple stages and genetic operations. In this project, symmetric key cryptography is also used.Additionally, a random key will be produced.Data that has been decrypted is acceptable because there is no doubt that it differs from data that has been kept secret.

<h3> Evaluation Results </h3>

The D-GET is implemented in the Windows 8.1 64-BIT operating system with an AMD Athlon(tm) II X2 220 processor running at 2.80GHz and 4 GB of RAM. We run tests on a variety of secret data types to gauge the effectiveness of the suggested technique.

Cryptologists attempt to decrypt any encrypted data in order to learn what is contained therein using a variety of cryptanalytic, mathematical, and brute-force attacks. A strong encryption method is necessary to defeat them. Therefore, a few characteristics must be attained. Here There is no connection between the values of sensitive data before encryption and the values of encrypted data after encryption. The various hidden data components should be wrapped in encryption so that nothing is visible in its original position.

<h3> Conclusions </h3>

In this project, D-GET is used. The D-GET is a more reliable encryption method that is based on multiple iterations and genetic activities. Additionally included are operations, encryption, rotation, crossover, mutation, and reshapes that raise the bar for encryption. D-GET operations and alterations to the size and format of the starting data. Additionally, the likelihood of performing cryptanalysis and decrypting the cypher is reduced by the negligible relationship between the hidden data and its encrypted data. 

The method also has multiple layers of defence that ensure confidentiality, give data more security, productivity, and robustness, and shield it from detection. In the future, we would standardise D-GET and work to reduce transmission.
